# SimpleRPGGame
A fun project I decided to do to write some Python code. You play as JÃ¸rgen trying to survive for 4 days battling enemies 
and coming across random events.

# Getting Started
To run the game you have to download all files and run the game.py

# Running the tests
I wrote some automated tests for menu.py using the mock module. But due to the complexity of the menu's functions the coverage is not great.
